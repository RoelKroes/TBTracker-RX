/************************************************************************************
* TBTracker-RX - roel@kroes.com
* 
* A mobile software platform for receiving LoRa transmissions and uploading those 
* to amateur.sondehub.org. The software is designed to run on the esp32 platform. 
* A TTGO T-Beam would be ideal. It has WiFi connectivity, a simple web interface and support for a OLED display
* 
* First adjust the settings in the settings file <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
* 
* Be sure you run the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
*
* V0.0.10 pre-release
* 22-May-2023: Architecture changes to minimise the time taken to get the radio listening for the next packet.
* 22-MAY-2023: Updated for RadioLib 6.0.0 - https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib/releases/tag/6.0.0
* 24-MAY-2023: Re-enabled OLED Flash and Flash Pin on Packet Receive
*
* v0.0.9 pre-release
* 03-MAR-2023: Serial port baudrate to 115200

* 07-APR-2023: disabled temporary timed OLED update and OLED Flash and PIN flash
*
* v0.0.8
* 23-FEB-2023: Added support for different visual modes for the OLED (default, all, chase)
* 24-FEB-2023: Added support for a "FLASH PIN" which will set HIGH for 300ms when a packet is received (new entry in settings file!)
*
* Thanks to Star Holden, Luc Bodson and Eelco de Graaff for testing and suggesting improvements
*
* v0.0.7
* 03-FEB-2023: The link to Sondehub in the web interface now opens in a new window
* 03-FEB-2023: Software now works also without WiFi (data on Serial output or OLED display)
*
* v0.0.6
* 29-JAN-2023: Added a parser for the APRS packets to display on the Serial interface, webinterface and SSD1306 display
*
* v0.0.5
* 21-JAN-2023: Print length of received packet in the Serial monitor
* 21-JAN-2023: Check if the received packet is indeed a HAB telemetry packet
* 21-JAN-2023: Removed the RAW telemetry string from the Serial monitor to avoid double info and unreadable characters
* 21-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa-APRS packets
* 21-JAN-2023: Added a packet Log trail in the web interface
*  
* v0.0.4

* 20-JAN-2023: Added support for LoRa Mode 1 (Implicit mode, Error coding 4:5, Bandwidth 20.8kHz,  SF 6, Low data rate optimize off)
* 20-JAN-2023: Added support for showing and changing the LoRa Mode in the webinterface
* 20-JAN-2023: Solved several bugs
* 20-JAN-2023: Added autotune to the radio (based on the frquency error calculated by the radio)
*
* v0.0.3
* 06-JAN-2023: Added SNR, RSSI to the web interface

* 23-DEC-2022: Changed the wording of "Test mode" in the webinterface
*
